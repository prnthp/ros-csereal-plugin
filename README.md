Features a simple drag-n-drop interface, making it super easy to implement ROS in your Unity3D project.

## Compilation
Precompiled x64 binary is provided in the Unity directory.

## Dependencies
- [rosserial](http://wiki.ros.org/rosserial)
- [osiris](https://github.com/prnthp/fillet): This is a helper package to maintain rosserial nodes, since as of April 2018, cannot re-establish connections with rosserial_windows. ROS Csereal can call the reaper service in the osiris package to kill rosserial nodes and revive them.

## Installation
- **rosserial.unitypackage** - Double click or drag into Unity Editor
- **ros-csereal-unity.dll** - Copy to your Unity project's folder (*NOT ./Assets*). That folder should *contain* the folder Assets.

## Notes about .NET 4.0 (Unity 2018+)
ROSCSereal.cs uses DynamicInvoke() for calling C++ functions so the library unloads when using the editor. This has been broken in Unity 2018 and up for some reason. (Something related to .NET 4.0) Use the ROSCSereal.cs found in Unity/DeployScripts instead that uses the standard mono function calls. The only downside if is it crashes or hangs, the plugin does not unload upon hitting the play button, instead you'll have to completely close Unity and re-open the project.
